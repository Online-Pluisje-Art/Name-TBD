    message: Ah, good, I see you managed to escape. Do you still have the keycard?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b5edd52833d70bb4cb698648cb3a1c81, type: 2}

    direction: 1
    message: My identity is of no concern right now. All you need to know is that
      I want to protect the people from the government's tyranny. As you just heard
      the rebelion you have been fighting for these past years is actually a governmental
      puppet organisation.

    message: How can that be true, what use would the government have in terrorizing
      their own people?!

    direction: 1
    message: "Power, a people that are scared of an enemy will accept a lot more
      oppression from their government, \u2018everyone needs to make sacrifices to
      win the war\u2019, or so they are taught."

    message: "Poor citizens that either don\u2019t care, do it for the money or are
      just straight up sadists."

      have a lot of first hand experience."

    message: "So\u2026 what now\u2026? My life has been a lie, everything I\u2019ve
      worked for has been for nothing and my best friend betrayed me. What is there
      left for me to do?"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d7f5a4e2da8031348b59ea5eb6d2ebca, type: 2}

    message: Well, you could try to be an actual hero for the people.

      that great apparently\u2026"

    message: You have that keycard, remember. That key can grant you unrestricted
      access to the galaxy wide broadcasting network. If we could reach a broadcasting
      terminal we could expose their practices. The resulting riots would be too
      much for even them to handle.

    direction: 0
    message: Okay I like where you are going with this. But not to burst your bubble,
      I have basic hacking skills but I doubt I can actually use that keycard. Those
      systems are way too advanced for me.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d7f5a4e2da8031348b59ea5eb6d2ebca, type: 2}
    direction: 1
    message: That just means we need to get someone who does know how to work with
      those systems.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b5edd52833d70bb4cb698648cb3a1c81, type: 2}
    direction: 0
    message: The only people who know how to operate those systems are the maintainers
      themselves. How do you reckon we are going to persuade them? They are fiercely
      loyal to the government.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d7f5a4e2da8031348b59ea5eb6d2ebca, type: 2}
    direction: 1
    message: Almost correct. There is one other person besides the maintainers that
      knows how those systems work. Its creator.

      me?

      best secured prison in the entire galaxy!
