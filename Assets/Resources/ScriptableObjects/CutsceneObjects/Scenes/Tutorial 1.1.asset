    message: "Adam Blackwell: \u201CIt should have been a simple mission like usual,
      the only difference was I did it on my own accord so I didn't have my gear.
      Looking back at it now, going there was a big mistake. I got a tip from my
      old friend and colleague Jonah Spade about rebel activity on this far out jungle
      planet. This could have given us the edge in the ongoing conflict. If only
      I'd known then what I know now I would have never wasted my life on this lie.
      But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning of the mission."
