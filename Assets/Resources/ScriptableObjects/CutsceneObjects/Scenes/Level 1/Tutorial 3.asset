    message: See those crates and barrels lying around? Those objects can be used
      as cover. Every action you or the enemy makes has a chance to hit the enemy
      but when you or an enemy is behind cover the chances lower. Also the further
      away you are from an enemy the less likely you are to hit, this also counts
      the other way so use this to your advantage!
