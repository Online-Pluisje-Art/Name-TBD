    message: You see that red marker with a locked symbol? That is a puzzle. When
      you stand next to the marker, select it and you will enter the puzzle sequence.
      The puzzle involves a simple sliding tile puzzle. The goal is to rearrange
      the tiles so a proper image will be visible. When the image is complete the
      puzzle is finished and a door will open for you to pass through and continue!
